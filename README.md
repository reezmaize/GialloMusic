<div align="justify">This project explores the idea and details the process of interpreting Giallo films as music. Gialli are highly expressive, Italian horror films which reached the peak of their popularity in the 1970s, and are known for their powerful suspense, plot twists, and artistic murder scenes. The work manifests as an 8 minute, binarual electronic piece, which serves as a representation of one film, composed according to values extracted from the respective film using csound.


The film selected is [Suspiria (1977)](https://letterboxd.com/film/suspiria/ "Suspiria on Letterboxd"), Directed by Dario Argento.
