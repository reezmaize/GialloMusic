This project explores the idea and details the process of interpreting Giallo films as music. Gialli are highly expressive, Italian horror films which reached the peak of their popularity in the 1970s, and are known for their powerful suspense and plot twists. The work manifests as three 4-6 minute electronic pieces, each a representation of one film, composed according to values extracted from the respective film.

The films selected are Suspiria (1977), Deep Red (1975), and Seven Blood-Stained Orchids (1972).
