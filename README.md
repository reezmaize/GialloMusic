Gialli are highly expressive, Italian horror films which reached the peak of their popularity in the 1970s, and are known for their powerful suspense, plot twists, and artistic murder scenes. The work manifests as an 8 minute electronic piece, which serves as a representation of one film, composed according to values extracted from the respective film using csound.
